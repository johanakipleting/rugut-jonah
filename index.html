<p>The Nandi is a sub-community of the Kalenjin ethnic group. They referred to themselves as 'Chemwalindet' or 'Chemwal' before adopting the name Nandi in the mid 19th century. They speak Nandi, a Kalenjin dialect. The majority of the Nandi are found in Nandi County, a region with many tourist attractions and home to many world athletic champions. Some of the best renowned Nandi people are leader Koitalel arap Samoei, and athletes Pamela Jelimo, Janet Chepkosgei and Kipchoge Keino.</p>


<h2>  our shared past, present, and future</h2>

Dating back centuries, the stories and traditions of the peoples of Kenya are some of the most fascinating in the world. They have enriched the country through social, economic, political and cultural activities, each with their own unique stories. Today, 44 communities are officially recognized by the government, and are classified into three linguistic groups: the Bantu, the Nilotic and the Cushitic speakers. The National Museums of Kenya holds objects telling the stories of the communities, which represent the country's ethnic diversity and vibrant cultures. Many of the cultural practices are still embraced today, but have been influenced by the changes in society. This exhibit celebrates the countryâ€™s rich heritage through the Nandi community.
